Hi there, thanks for dropping by :-D

This repository contains code that demonstrates how one can do OpenPGP with Java and JavaScript.
The code also shows how to exchange OpenPGP-encrypted messages between Java and JavaScript! 

You can find all the posts explaining this stuff on my blog, [Codes And Notes](https://codesandnotes.be).

At the moment, only key generation code is available. The rest will come in a short time! 

* [Generate OpenPGP-compliant keys using Java](https://www.codesandnotes.be/2018/07/17/openpgp-java-keys-generation/)
* Java encryption and decryption with Bouncy-GPG
* Front end encryption with OpenPGP.js library
* Exchange encrypted messages between Java and JavaScript
