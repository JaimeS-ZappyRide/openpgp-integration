Hi there, thanks for dropping by :-D

This repository contains code that demonstrates how one can do OpenPGP with Java and JavaScript.

The code also shows how to exchange OpenPGP-encrypted messages between Java and JavaScript! 

There is... no code at the moment because I'm still working on the tutorial blog posts that go with it. Be patient!

You will be able to find the related blog posts on my blog, [Codes And Notes](https://codesandnotes.be)
