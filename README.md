Hi there, thanks for dropping by :-D

This repository contains code that demonstrates how one can do OpenPGP with Java and JavaScript.
The code also shows how to exchange OpenPGP-encrypted messages between Java and JavaScript! 

At the moment, only key generation code is available. The rest will come in a short time! 

You will soon find the post explaining all this stuff on my blog, [Codes And Notes](https://codesandnotes.be).
