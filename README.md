Hi there, thanks for dropping by :-D

This repository contains code that demonstrates how one can do OpenPGP with Java and JavaScript.
The code also shows how to exchange OpenPGP-encrypted messages between Java and JavaScript! 

You can find all the posts explaining this stuff on my blog, [Codes And Notes](https://codesandnotes.be).
